Saudi Arabia has introduced additional credentialing steps for nursing applicants to improve verification and reduce document delays. If you are applying through a licensed agency, the process is smoother—but you still need to prepare the right documents early.

## What changed in 2025
- Digital verification is emphasized more than before.
- Credential checks can happen **before** your final contract timeline.
- Some steps are now sequential (you must finish step A before moving to step B).

## What you should prepare (recommended)
- Passport (valid, clear scan)
- Nursing diploma + transcript
- License/registration proof
- Work experience letters (if available)
- Medical check results (when requested)
- Passport photos (clean, recent)

## Common delays (avoid these)
- Mismatch in names across documents (spelling differences)
- Low-quality scans or cropped stamps
- Missing graduation date or incomplete transcripts

## Practical checklist (fast)
1. Confirm your name matches passport format everywhere.
2. Scan documents in high resolution (no shadows).
3. Keep a single folder for originals + digital copies.
4. Ask your agency for the latest destination checklist.

## Next step
If you're unsure which documents need certification or notarization for your specific facility/job role, contact us and we’ll guide you based on your profile.
